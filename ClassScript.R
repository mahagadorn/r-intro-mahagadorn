empty.vector <- logical()
empty.vector
numbers <- c(1,3,5,3)
#the c() concatenates the vectors on length one
#so for this "1", "3", "5", and "3" are all vectors of length one
# c() makes a vector of length four from the four vectors of length one

vector.maths <- numbers*4.5
vector.maths
#runs mathematical operation on the vector "numbers"
#this runs the mathematical on the ENTIRE vector at the same time
#Result
#> vector.maths
